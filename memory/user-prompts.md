**Prompt:**
> read changes.md, find why the readme.md is so short? Is it possible to keep it long, I want to to be sufficient for quick reference. Don't want to make it less useful that it used to be like

**Answered:** Explained slim mode was forced by 712KB README breaking GitHub renderer (changes.md Step 3). Outlined expansion options (bump LITE_PICKS, add ToC, hybrid).

### 2026-05-17
**Prompt:**
> you say this, but for me it was loading the full readme correctly, why do you think that might be the case?

**Answered:** Corrected — GitHub "Uh oh" is intermittent render-pipeline timeout, not hard size cap. Caching, server load, anchor count all factor. Slim mode defensible only for reliability+speed, not size ban.

### 2026-05-17
**Prompt:**
> UI for graph on phone is broken, the sidebar is taking too much space, make it collapsable
